# CheeZJokes App

This project is created to practice with React Lifecycle.

## CheeZJokes App

▶ When the page loads, it should fetch 10 jokes from the API of https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api

▶ Each time you click on the button 10 new jokes will be shown, but if there is any repeated joke, it will not be shown. 

▶ A spinner is shown while the new jokes are loaded.

▶ The jokes are stored in local storage so even if you reload the page the jokes will be the same.

▶ You can vote each joke clicking in the arrows. The smileys on the right will change according to the score. Moreover the jokes will change its position depending on its score.

▶ The colors of the circle showing the score change color and the smileys move if you hover the mouse over them.
